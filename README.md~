# blog-with-in-place-comments
A blogging platform with in place comments
I assume that the JSON input to the API will have \n\n as a double newline as a bifurcation between two paragraphs.
Let's say you deployed the application on localhost on port 8080.

APIs

1. Add a blog post

    "plainText": "This is Zafar.\n\nLots of people have done this."
  }
}
